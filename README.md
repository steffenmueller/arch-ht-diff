# arch-ht-diff
Magma-code for computing an upper bound on the archimedean local height difference on an elliptic curve over a number field. This implements an algorithm described in Archimedean local height differences on elliptic curves by Steffen MÃ¼ller and Corinna Stumpe. The idea is based on earlier work by Michael Stoll for Jacobians of genus-2 and hyperelliptic genus-3 curves.
