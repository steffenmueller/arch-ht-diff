# arch-ht-diff
Magma-code for computing an upper bound on the archimedean local height difference on an elliptic curve over a number field. This implements an algorithm described in Archimedean local height differences on elliptic cuves by Steffen MÃ¼ller and Corinna Stumpe. The idea is based on earlier work by Michael Stoll for Jacobians of curves of genus 2 and 3.
